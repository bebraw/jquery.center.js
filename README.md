# jquery.center.js - Centers your elements

This little plugin centers your element. Just $element.center().

Based primarily on [a Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210717/using-jquery-to-center-a-div-on-the-screen/210733#210733) with a few tweaks of my own.

## Installation

Add prepackaged `dist/jquery.center.js` to your page. There is also a minified version available.

Alternatively you may install the plugin via Bower.

## License

jquery.center.js is available under MIT. See LICENSE for more details.
